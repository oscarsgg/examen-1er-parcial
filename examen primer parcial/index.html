                Our Story
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                The General Muir, established in January 2013 at Emory Point, is a modern American restaurant 
                inspired by classic New York Jewish Deli, returning it to its hand-crafted roots. 
                Traditional favorites are honored — pastrami is cured and smoked in house, bagels are 
                hand rolled and kettle boiled — and joined by dishes going beyond tradition, focusing on 
                fresh ingredients and simple preparations. A second location in Sandy Springs opened in 2021. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The restaurant is named for the refugee transport ship that brought co-owner Jennifer Johnson's 
                mother and grandparents, Holocaust survivors, to New York in 1949.  
                <a href="https://www.thegeneralmuir.com/s/Origin-of-the-Name-The-General-Muir.pdf">Read more about 
                the origin of our name</a> and see the video by Atlanta Magazine below.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The General Muir serves breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch at both locations, 
                plus dinner at the Emory location, and offers an espresso bar serving locally-roasted 
                Dancing Goats coffee as well as a full bar of wine, beer, spirits, and cocktails. 
                Next door to the original Emory location, you’ll find TGM Bread and TGM Soup Co. pairing 
                fresh baked breads and soups for a quick lunch, as well as loaves to take home. TGM Bread 
                bakes all of the bread daily for both locations, the rest of the Rye Restaurants family, 
                and many other restaurants around town.
            </p>

                The Partners
            </h2>

            <p>
                The General Muir is owned by Jennifer and Ben Johnson, Shelley Sweet, 
                and Chef Todd Ginsberg, who also partner on 
                <a href="http://www.fredsmeatandbread.com/">Fred's Meat & Bread and Yalla </a>
                in Krog Street Market and Wood's Chapel BBQ in the historic Summerhill neighborhood 
                of Atlanta — the Rye Restaurants family of restaurants. 

                The Johnsons, husband and wife, opened West Egg on Atlanta’s Westside in 2004. 
                Both Jennifer (our "office girl") and Ben (fondly referred to as "errand boy," 
                although Renaissance man is more like it!) are former attorneys who practiced law 
                in Atlanta for nearly 7 and 11 years, respectively, before embarking on a second 
                career in hospitality. West Egg proudly celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shelley Sweet found her passion for the restaurant industry after graduating college 
                and working in graphic design, beginning her restaurant career at West Egg when it 
                opened in 2004. She joined the Concentrics Restaurant Group in 2006, serving as a 
                manager at Two Urban Licks, Assistant General Manager at Murphy’s, and ultimately 
                as General Manager of TAP from 2008 to 2010. She was the opening General Manager 
                at Hugh Acheson’s Empire State South. Coming full circle, Shelley rejoined West Egg 
                in 2011 as General Manager, becoming a partner in 2014. Shelley, Jennifer, and Ben 
                continue to partner on West Egg, with Chef Andrew Smith. Shelley is a member of 
                Les Dames d’Escoffier International, Atlanta Chapter, and recently served on the 
                Georgia Restaurant Association Board of Directors.

            <p>
                Todd Ginsberg is a 2014 and 2015 James Beard Foundation Semifinalist for Best Chef, 
                Southeast and a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York. 
                He started his career at The Dining Room at The Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta under Joel 
                Antunes and Bruno Menard, led the kitchens at Asher in Roswell, Georgia, and Madison's 
                in Highlands, North Carolina, and spent time at Lucas Carton in Paris and at Alain 
                Ducasse in New York. Upon his return to Atlanta, he worked for the Concentrics 
                Restaurants group, serving as chef at both TAP and Trois. Todd was the chef at 
                Bocado from its opening in 2009 until partnering with Shelley, Jennifer, and Ben 
                to open The General Muir.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2014 the Georgia Restaurant Association honored Jennifer, Ben, Shelley and Todd 
                as Restaurateurs of the Year and, in 2018, StarChefs recognized them as Rising Star 
                Restaurateurs.

        <p>The below images, taken from the deck of the Gen. Muir, were provided by Robert Boehm,
            whose father, Henry Boehm (Henryk Bohm) (center of photo on left) arrived in this country 
            aboard the Gen. Muir in March 1949, on the same voyage as Jennifer’s mother. 
            We made this incredible connection after the restaurant opened. Mr. Boehm, a 
            Holocaust survivor, was a dentist, athlete, and Conservatory-trained operatic singer 
            from Lwow, Poland (now L’viv, Ukraine), just 40 miles from where Jennifer’s grandparents 
            lived before the war. We appreciate the Boehm family sharing these images; you can see 
            them in person at our Sandy Springs location. </p>
